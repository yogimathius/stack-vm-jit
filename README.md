# Stack-Based Virtual Machine with JIT Compilation

Built in Rust for safety, performance, and concurrency with a comprehensive instruction set and advanced runtime features.

## Scope and Direction
- Project path: `systems-programming/stack-vm-jit`
- Primary tech profile: Node.js/TypeScript or JavaScript, Rust
- Audit date: `2026-02-08`

## What Appears Implemented
- Detected major components: `src/`, `web/`
- No clear API/controller routing signals were detected at this scope
- Cargo metadata is present for Rust components

## API Endpoints
- No explicit HTTP endpoint definitions were detected at the project root scope

## Testing Status
- `cargo test` appears applicable for Rust components
- This audit did not assume tests are passing unless explicitly re-run and captured in this session

## Operational Assessment
- Estimated operational coverage: **39%**
- Confidence level: **medium**

## Future Work
- Document and stabilize the external interface (CLI, API, or protocol) with explicit examples
- Run the detected tests in CI and track flakiness, duration, and coverage
- Validate runtime claims in this README against current behavior and deployment configuration
